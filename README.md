# API-Playground
A simple and intentionally vulnerable application that serves as a playground for experimenting with API vulnerabilities. The API utilises restful architecture to simulate managing an online store, simple data structures are used to house data rather than a NoSQL database such as MongoDB. 

API-Playground is built using node.js, a run time environment for JavaScript built on top of the Chrome v8 JavaScript engine. Node.js on an abstract level allows developers to build the backend of their applications using JavaScript. Node.js is often compared to web application frameworks such as Django or React however, Node.js is simply a runtime environment in which JS code can be executed without the use of a browser. Node.js is praised for its asynchronous event driven architecture, allowing developers to build scalable web applications. 

Node.js was chosen for this project because of these qualities and also due to its popularity, large support base and user friendly package manager "Node Package Manager" (NPM).
